Hello everyone! My personal website is now complete. During the process, I learned new techniques that I would like to share, along with some of the sites that inspired me.

## Tech Stacks

- [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app)：Multi-language support for the website.
- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)：A useful animation library that can simplify complex animation effects, which may be more difficult to achieve with tailwindcss alone.
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/)：My website uses a postgresql platform to track **post views**.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)：This ORM library is designed for easy interaction with MySQL databases and provides intuitive APIs that simplify the database operation process.
- [Velite](https://velite.js.org/)：Manage the content of my blog posts and projects, and can easily define the information needed for a post, such as post title, description, release date, etc.

## Inspiration

I have learned from experience that UI design for a personal website can be time-consuming. When lacking inspiration, the following sites can provide a variety of options and save design time:

- [Godly](https://godly.website/)

In addition, the following are some feature-rich websites with modern and beautiful UI design：
